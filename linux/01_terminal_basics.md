# BASH

(Notes from linuxjourney.com)

The shell program bash (Bourne Again shell): almost all Linux distributions will default to the bash shell. There are other shells available such as ksh, zsh, tsch

Depending on the distribution the shell prompt might change, but for the most part it should adhere to the following format:

```bash
username@hostname:current_directory

pete@icebox:/home/pete $
```

## 1. simple commands

The `echo` command just prints out the text arguments to the display.

```bash
$ echo Hello World
```

Some other commands:

```bash
$ whoami
$ date
```

## 2. pwd (Print Working Directory)
Everything in Linux is a file. Every file is organized in a hierarchical directory tree. The first directory in the filesystem is aptly named the `root` directory. The root directory has many folders and files which you can store more folders and files, etc. Here is an example of what the directory tree looks like:


```
/
|— bin
|   |— file1
|   |— file2
|— etc
|   |— file3
|   `— directory1
|       |— file4
|       `— file5
|— home
|— var
```


The location of these files and directories are referred to as `paths`. If a folder named `home` with a folder inside of it named `pete` and another folder in that folder called `Movies`, that path would look like this: `/home/pete/Movies`.

Navigation of the filesystem, much like real life is helpful if you know where you are and where you are going. To see where you are, you can use the `pwd` command, this command means “print working directory” and it just shows you which directory you are in, note the path stems from the root directory.

```bash
$ pwd
```

## 3. cd (Change Directory)
Now that you know where you are, let’s see if we can move around the filesystem a bit. Remember we’ll need to navigate our way using paths. There are two different ways to specify a path, with absolute and relative paths.

**Absolute path**: This is the path from the root directory. The root is the head honcho. The root directory is commonly shown as a slash. Every time your path starts with `/` it means you are starting from the **root directory**. For example, `/home/pete/Desktop`.

**Relative path**: This is the path from where you are currently in filesystem. If I was in location `/home/pete/Documents` and wanted to get to a directory inside Documents called taxes, I don’t have to specify the whole path from root like `/home/pete/Documents/taxes`, I can just go to `taxes/` instead.

Now that you know how paths work, we just need something to help us change to the directory we want to. Luckily, we have `cd` or “change directory” to do that.

```bash
$ cd /home/pete/Pictures
```

So now I’ve changed my directory location to `/home/pete/Pictures`.

Now from this directory I have a folder inside called `Hawaii`, I can navigate to that folder with:

```bash
$ cd Hawaii
```

Notice how I just used the name of the folder? It’s because I was already in `/home/pete/Pictures`.

It can get pretty tiring navigating with absolute and relative paths all the time, luckily there are some shortcuts to help you out.


* `.` (current directory). This is the directory you are currently in.
* `..` (parent directory). Takes you to the directory above your current.
* `~` (home directory). This directory defaults to your “home directory”. Such as /home/pete.
* `-` (previous directory). This will take you to the previous directory you were just at.

```bash
$ cd .
$ cd ..
$ cd ~
$ cd -
```

## 4. ls (List Directories)
Now that we know how to move around the system, how do we figure out what is available to us? Right now it’s like we are moving around in the dark. Well, we can use the wonderful `ls` command to list directory contents. The `ls` command will list directories and files in the current directory by default, however you can specify which path you want to list the directories of.

```bash
$ ls
$ ls /home/pete
```

ls is a quite useful tool, it also shows you detailed information about the files and directories you are looking at.

Also note that not all files in a directory will be visible. Filenames that start with `.` are hidden, you can view them however with the `ls` command and pass the `-a` flag to it (a for all).

```bash
$ ls -a
```

There is also one more useful ls flag, `-l` for long, this shows a detailed list of files in a long format. This will show you detailed information, starting from the left: file permissions, number of links, owner name, owner group, file size, timestamp of last modification, and file/directory name.

```bash
$ ls -l
```

```
pete@icebox:~$ ls -l
total 80
drwxr-x— 7 pete penguingroup   4096 Nov 20 16:37 Desktop
drwxr-x— 2 pete penguingroup   4096 Oct 19 10:46  Documents
drwxr-x— 4 pete penguingroup   4096 Nov 20 09:30 Downloads
drwxr-x— 2 pete penguingroup   4096 Oct  7 13:13   Music
drwxr-x— 2 pete penguingroup   4096 Sep 21 14:02 Pictures
drwxr-x— 2 pete penguingroup   4096 Jul 27 12:41   Public
drwxr-x— 2 pete penguingroup   4096 Jul 27 12:41   Templates
drwxr-x— 2 pete penguingroup   4096 Jul 27 12:41   Videos
```

Commands have things called flags (or arguments or options, whatever you want to call it) to add more functionality. See how we added `-a` and `-l`, well you can add them both together with `-la`. The order of the flags determines which order it goes in, most of the time this doesn’t really matter so you can also do `ls -al` and it would still work.

```bash
$ ls -la
```

Some more commands:

* `ls -R`: recursively list directory contents
* `ls -r`: reverse order while sorting
* `ls -t`: sort by modification time, newest first


## 5. touch
Let’s learn how to make some files. A very simple way is to use the touch command. Touch allows you to the create new empty files.

```bash
$ touch mysuperduperfile
And boom, new file!
```

Touch is also used to **change timestamps** on existing files and directories. Give it a try, do an `ls -l` on a file and note the timestamp, then touch that file and it will update the timestamp.

## 6. file: to find the file type
The filename didn’t conform to standard naming like with other operating systems like Windows. Normally you would expect a file called banana.jpeg and expect a JPEG picture file.

In Linux, filenames aren’t required to represent the contents of the file. You can create a file called funny.gif that isn’t actually a GIF.

To find out what kind of file a file is, you can use the file command. It will show you a description of the file’s contents.

```bash
$ file banana.jpg
```

## 7. cat
How to read a file. A simple command to use is the cat command, short for **concatenate**, it not only displays file contents but it can combine multiple files and show you the output of them.

```bash
$ cat dogfile birdfile
```

It’s not great for viewing large files and it’s only meant for short content. There are many other tools that we use to view larger text files.


## 8. less
If you are viewing text files larger than a simple output, less is more. (There is actually a command called `more` that does something similar, so this is ironic.) The text is displayed **in a paged manner**, so you can navigate through a text file page by page.

Once you’re in the less command, you can actually use other keyboard commands to navigate in the file.

```bash
$ less /home/pete/Documents/text1
``` 
Use the following command to navigate through less:

* q - Used to quit out of less and go back to your shell.
* Page up, Page down, Up and Down - Navigate using the arrow keys and page keys. 
* g - Moves to beginning of the text file.
* G - Moves to the end of the text file.
* /search - You can search for specific text inside the text document. Prefacing the words you want to search with /
* h - If you need a little help about how to use less while you’re in less, use help.


## 9. history
In your shell, there is a history of the commands that you previously entered, you can actually look through these commands. This is quite useful when you want to find and run a command you used previously without actually typing it again.

```bash
$ history
```

Want to run the same command did before, just hit the up arrow.

Want to run the previous command without typing it again? Use `!!`. If you typed `cat file1` and want to run it again, you can actually just go `!!` and it will run the last command you ran.

Another history shortcut is `ctrl-R`, this is the reverse search command, if you hit `ctrl-R` and you start typing parts of the command you want it will show you matches and you can just navigate through them by hitting the `ctrl-R` key again. Once you found the command you want to use again, just hit the `Enter` key.

Our terminal is getting a little cluttered no? Let’s do a little cleanup, use the clear command to clear up your display.


```bash
$ clear
```

One of the most useful features in any command-line environment is **tab completion**. If you start typing the beginning of a command, file, directory, etc and hit the Tab key, it will autocomplete based on what it finds in the directory you are searching as long as you don’t have any other files that start with those letters. For example if you were trying to run the command chrome, you can type chr and press Tab and it will autocomplete chrome.


## 10. cp (Copy)
Let’s start making some copies of these files. Much like copy and pasting files in other operating systems, the shell gives us an even simpler way of doing that.

```bash
$ cp mycoolfile /home/pete/Documents/cooldocs
```

mycoolfile is the file you want to copy and `/home/pete/Documents/cooldocs` is where you are copying the file to.

You can copy multiple files and directories as well as use *wildcards*. A wildcard is a character that can be substituted for a pattern based selection, giving you more flexibility with searches. You can use wildcards in every command for more flexibility.

* `*` the wildcard of wildcards, it’s used to represent **all single characters or any string**.
* `?` used to represent **one** character 
* `[]` used to represent any character **within the brackets**
 
```bash
$ cp *.jpg /home/pete/Pictures
```

This will copy all files with the .jpg extension in your current directory to the Pictures directory.

A useful command is to use the `-r` flag, this will recursively copy the files and directories within a directory.

Try to do a `cp` on a directory that contains a couple of files to your Documents directory. Didn’t work did it? Well that’s because you’ll need to copy over the files and directories inside as well with -r command.

```bash
$ cp -r Pumpkin/ /home/pete/Documents
```

One thing to note, if you copy a file over to a directory that has the same filename, the file will be **overwritten** with whatever you are copying over. This is no bueno if you have a file that you don’t want to get accidentally overwritten. You can use the `-i` flag (interactive) to prompt you before overwriting a file.

```bash
$ cp -i mycoolfile /home/pete/Pictures
```

## 11. mv (Move)
Used for moving files and also **renaming** them. Quite similar to the `cp` command in terms of flags and functionality.

You can **rename** files like this:
```bash
$ mv oldfile newfile
```

Or you can actually **move** a file to a different directory:

```bash
$ mv file2 /home/pete/Documents
```
And move more than one file:

```bash
$ mv file_1 file_2 /somedirectory
```

You can rename directories as well:

```bash
$ mv directory1 directory2
```

Like `cp`, if you `mv` a file or directory it will **overwrite** anything in the same directory. So you can use the `-i` flag to prompt you before overwriting anything.

```bash
mv -i directory1 directory2
```

Let’s say you did want to `mv` a file to overwrite the previous one. You can also make a **backup** of that file (`-b`) and it will just rename the old version with a `~`.

```bash
$ mv -b directory1 directory2
```


## 12. mkdir (Make Directory)
We’re gonna need some directories to store all these files we’ve been working on. The `mkdir` command (Make Directory) is useful for that, it will create a directory if it doesn’t already exist. You can even make multiple directories at the same time.

```bash
$ mkdir books paintings
```

You can also create subdirectories at the same time with the `-p` (parent flag).

```bash
$ mkdir -p books/hemmingway/favorites
```


## 13. rm (Remove)
Now I think we have too many files, let’s remove some files. To remove files you can use the `rm` command. The `rm` (remove) command is used to **delete** files and directories.

```bash
$ rm file1
```

**Take caution when using rm, there is no magical trash can that you can fish out removed files. Once they are gone, they are gone for good, so be careful.**

Fortunately there are some safety measures put into place, so the average joe can’t just remove a bunch of important files. **Write-protected** files will prompt you for confirmation before deleting them. If a directory is write-protected it will also not be easily removed.

Now if you don’t care about any of that, you can absolutely remove a bunch of files.

```bash
$ rm -f file1
```

`-f` or **force option** tells `rm` to remove all files, whether they are write protected or not, without prompting the user (as long as you have the appropriate permissions).

```bash
$ rm -i file
```

Adding the `-i` flag like many of the other commands, will give you a prompt on whether you want to actually remove the files or directories.

```bash
$ rm -r directory
```

You can’t just `rm` a **directory** by default, you’ll need to add the `-r` flag (recursive) to remove all the files and any subdirectories it may have.

You can remove a directory with the `rmdir` command.

```bash
$ rmdir directory
```


## 14. find
With all these files we have on the system it can get a little hectic trying to find a specific one. Well there’s a command we can use for that, find!

```bash
$ find /home -name puppies.jpg
```

With `find` you’ll have to specify:

* The directory you’ll be searching it, 
* What you’re searching for: name (`-name`) or type (`-type`) 
* The name of that you´re searching for.

In this case we are trying to find a file by the name (`-name`) of puppies.jpg.

You can specify what type of file you are trying to find.

```bash
$ find /home -type d -name MyFolder
```

You can see that I set the type of file (`-type`) I’m trying to find as (`d`) for directory and I’m still searching by the name of MyFolder.

One cool thing to note is that find doesn’t stop at the directory you are searching, it will look inside any subdirectories that directory may have as well.

## 15. help
Linux has some great built-in tools to help you how to use a command or check what flags are available for a command. One tool, help, is a built-in bash command that provides help for other bash commands (`echo`, `logout`, `pwd`, etc).

```bash
$ help echo
```

This will give you a description and the options you can use when you want to run echo. For other executable programs, it’s convention to have an option called `--help` or something similar.

```bash
$ echo --help
```

Not all developers who ship out executables will conform to this standard, but it’s probably your best shot to find some help on a program.


## 16. man
Gee I wish some of these programs had a manual so we can see some more information about them. Well luckily they do! Aptly named man pages, you can see the manuals for a command with the `man` command.

```bash
$ man ls
```

Man pages are manuals that are by default built into most Linux operating systems. They provide documentation about commands and other aspects of the system.


## 17. whatis
Whew, we’ve learned quite a bit of commands so far, if you are ever feeling doubtful about what a command does, you can use the `whatis` command. The `whatis` command provides a brief description of command line programs.

```bash
$ whatis cat
```

The description gets sourced from the manual page of each command. If you ran whatis cat, you’d see there is a small blurb with a short description.


## 18. alias
Sometimes typing commands can get really repetitive, or if you need to type a long command many times, it’s best to have an alias you can use for that. To create an alias for a command you simply specify an alias name and set it to the command.

```bash
$ alias foobar='ls -la'
```

Now instead of typing `ls -la`, you can type `foobar` and it will execute that command, pretty neat stuff. Keep in mind that this command **won't save your alias after reboot**, so you'll need to add a **permanent** alias in:

```bash
~/.bashrc
```

or similar files if you want to have it persist after reboot.

You can **remove** aliases with the `unalias` command:

```bash
$ unalias foobar
``` 


## 19. exit
To exit from the shell, you can use the `exit` command

```bash
$ exit
```

Or the `logout` command:

```bash
$ logout
```

Or if you are working out of a terminal GUI, you can just close the terminal.
